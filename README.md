Project Summary

This project designs a normalized PostgreSQL database to manage Synapse Fest (DAU), covering events, tickets, sponsors, vendors, departments, accommodation, volunteers, merchandise, and transactions. It includes all SRS, ERD, schema, DDL, queries, triggers, and functions in the docs and SQL files, along with a minimal backend + frontend demo panel showcasing CRUD for one sample table.
